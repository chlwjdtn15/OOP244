1. If the dynamic memmory is not deallocated, the memmory will keep pilling up. To use memomry effectivley, delocation is needed.

2. Dynamic memory keeps containing information for future uses. If user does not delocate it, all memory will be filled. However user can always use that inforamtion anytime. I used dynamic memory with 'new' command.
	However, static memory holds inoformation for short time. It will only be used at that time. I used static memory with declaring variables such as 'count'

3. I learn how to make dynamic memory and static memory to be used. With dynamic memory, i could use it to make output the contents of it.
